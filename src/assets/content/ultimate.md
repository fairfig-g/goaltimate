### Rules for Ultimate players
- 4v4 = plenty of touches
- Assist from the clear zone to score 2 points instead of 1
- Sub out if you cause a turnover 
- Game to 5 points
- Continuous play, stall to 5 from anywhere om the pitch
- Game starts with a pull from the clear box: if it hits the goal post the pulling team gets the disc. 
- Score by catching a disc in the goal zone. The disc must fly through the goal. 
- If the disc is pushed or pulled through the goal plane the pass is valid but it is not a score 
- After a turnover or a score you have to “clear the disc” by establishing possession in the clear box.
- If the disc flies back through the goal (from the goal zone side) it is a turnover. 
- If any player in the attacking team hits the goal with their body it is a “goal fault”, which is a turnover.
- No double team, no picks, no straddling, no wrapping, no time outs. Just play!
