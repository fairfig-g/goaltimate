    <h2 id="what">What is it?</h3>
    <p>The first UK National Goaltimate Championship!</p>
    <p>Goaltimate remains a relatively unexplored discipline in the UK, with limited governance and structured competition worldwide. This championship, if it can be called as such with such vague governance structure for the sport, aims to invite players to try this new sport, and to create awareness of the updated rules. Based on the WFDF Ultimate rules, they aim to make the sport simple, fun, and more inclusive for people of different gender, age, and athleticism.</p>
    <p>UKU has kindly accepted to sanction this event to provide insurance cover and an organisational framework for the event organisers, so it requires all participants to have at least basic UKU membership.</p>
