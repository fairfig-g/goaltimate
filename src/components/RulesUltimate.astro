    <h3 id="rules-for-ultimate-players">Rules quickstart for Ultimate players</h3>
    <p>The rules of Goaltimate are based on the WFDF rules of Ultimate. This list shows all the differences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>4v4 (or 3v3). Game end after a team scores enough points, or at a specific time</b> (Event organisers can choose what works best for them.)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Casual games typically end once a team reaches 5 points.</li>
            <li>Tournament games may end at a specific time (eg: 20 minutes) to better manage the schedule.</li>
        </ul> 
        <li><b>Sub out if you cause a turnover.</b></li>   
        <ul>
            <li>The person that subs in is the one that has been on the sideline the longest.</li>
            <li>If two people were resposnsible for the turnover, call "Double" and substitute both.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Continuous play, stall to 5 from anywhere on the pitch.</b></li>
        <li>Game starts with a pull from the clear box: if it hits the goal post the pulling team gets the disc.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The team in the goal zone cannot touch the disc before it hits the ground or goes past the goal plane.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Score by catching a disc in the goal zone on an assist that went through the goal.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If the disc is pushed or pulled through the goal plane the pass is valid but it is not a score. (Call "Through")</li>
            <li>Scoring on an assist from the clear zone gives you 2 points instead of 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>After a turnover or a score you have to “clear the disc” by establishing possession in the clear box.</li>
        <li>If the disc flies back through the goal (from the goal zone side) it is a turnover. (Call "Backward")</li>
        <li>If any player makes non-trivial contact with the goal pole, it is a foul (Call "Goal foul"). </li>
        <ul>
            <li>if needed, stop the game to fix the goal</li>
            <li>If the foul did not affect the play, play on. If the foul affected the game, the team that did not foul can choose if they want to restart from the previous possession or keep the disc where it was after the foul call.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fewer interruptions: no time-outs and no calls for double team, picks, straddling, wrapping. Just play!</li>
    </ul>
