<h1 id="goaltimate-rules-2025">Goaltimate Rules 2025 </h1>
<h6 id="official-version-effective-from-2025-01-01">Official version effective from 2025-01-01 </h6>



<h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
<p>Goaltimate is a sport that puts sportsmanship and the basic joy of play at its core. As the first sport designed to be inclusive for people of differnet genders, age, or athletic ability, it is importnat to adhere to the no-contact rules. As a self-officiated game, it requires players know the rules and apply them fairly and with utmost integrity. Moreover, it is a great, fun sport to play. </p>
<p>These rules provide guidance on how to run your games. If you have any suggestions on how to make them better, please get in touch. </p>



<h2 id="1-spirit-of-the-game">1. Spirit of the Game </h2>
<p>
  <strong>Spirit of the Game (SoTG) is the core rule of Goaltimate. </strong> It requires each player to be honest, fair, and respectuful at all times. At all times, when playing recreationally or highly competitively, each player is responsible to adhere to the rules, foster mutual respect, and preserve the basic joy of play. Players must:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>know the rules; </li>
  <li>be fair-minded and objective; </li>
  <li>discuss their viewpoint clearly and briefly, using respectful words and body language and being mindful of potential cultural differences; </li>
</ul>
<p>It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no breach. If after discussion players cannot agree, or it is not clear and obvious what occurred in a play (and it is bound to happen, at times!) the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower. If there is a deliberate or egregious breach of the rules or Spirit of the Game, the captains should discuss this and determine an appropriate outcome, even if that outcome is not in accordance with a specific rule. </p>
<p>Calls should be discussed by the players directly involved in the play, and by players who had the best perspective on the play. Experience players can help novices with rule clarification. </p>



<h2 id="2-playing-field">2. Playing Field </h2>
<ul class="nolist">

</ul>



<h2 id="4-point-goal-and-game">4. Point, Goal and Game </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>4.1. Event organisers can define if they want to end a game when a team reaces a certain score (for example, a common rule for casual play is that the first team to score 5 points wins), or after a certain time (for example, end the game after 20 minutes). 
    <ul>
      <li>4.1.1 Event organisers can add additional rules to manage draws, or make the game more fun.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="5-teams">5. Teams </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>5.1. Each team will put a maximum of four (4) players and a minimum of three (3) players on the field during each point. </li>
  <li>5.2. Each team must designate a captain and a spirit captain to represent the team. </li>

<h2 id="6-starting-a-game">6. Starting a Game </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>6.1. Representatives of the two teams fairly determine which team is decide if they want to receive or throw the initial pull </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="7-the-pull">7. The Pull </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>7.1. At the start of the game play commences with a throw by the defence, called a “pull”. 
    <ul>
        <li>7.1.1. Teams must prepare for the pull without unreasonable delay. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7.2. The pull may be made only after both teams have signalled their readiness by having the puller and a player on offence raise a hand above their head. </li>
  <li>7.3. After signalling readiness all offensive players must stand in the goal zone until the pull is released. </li>
  <li>7.4. After signalling readiness all defensive players must stand in the clear zone until the pull is released. </li>
  <li>7.5. If a team breaches 7.3 (“false start”) or 7.4 (“offside”) the opposing team may call a violation. This must be called before the offence touches the disc.
    <ul>
        <li>7.5.1. After an “Offside” or "False start" call, the pull has to be redone.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7.6. If the pull hits the goal pole, the pulling team gets possession of the disc.
    <ul>
      <li>7.6.1. The team receiving the pull cannot touch the pull anymore.</li>
      <li>7.6.2. The pulling team restarts the game as if a turnover by the receiving team had occurred.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7.7. As soon as the pull is released, all players may move in any direction. 
  <li>7.8. The pull cannot be touched until when it hits the ground or flies past the goal plane.</li>
  <li>7.9. If an offensive player, in-bounds or out-of-bounds, touches the disc before it hits the ground, and the
    offensive team fails to subsequently establish possession, that is a turnover (a “dropped pull”).</li>
  <li>7.10. If an offensive player catches the pull and subsequently establishes possession, they must establish a pivot point at the location on the playing field nearest to where possession is established.</li>
  <li>7.11. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and never becomes out-of-bounds, the thrower must establish a pivot point where the disc stops. </li>
  <li>7.12. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes out-of-bounds without contacting an offensive player, the thrower must establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line. 
    <ul>
        <li>7.12.1. If the disc does contact an offensive player before it becomes out-of-bounds the thrower must establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7.13. If the disc contacts the out-of-bounds area without first touching the playing field or an offensive player, the thrower establishes the pivot point at the location on the playing area closest to where the disc went out-of-bounds. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="8-state-of-play">8. State of Play </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>8.1. Play is “dead”, and no turnover is possible: 
    <ul>
        <li>8.1.1. After the start of a point, until the pull is released; </li>
        <li>8.1.2. When the disc must be carried to the pivot location after the pull or a turnover, until a pivot point is established; </li>
        <li>8.1.3. After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage, until the disc is checked in; or </li>
        <li>8.1.4. After a disc hits the ground, until possession is established by the appropriate team. </li>
        <li>8.1.5. Players are allowed to move during dead play (unless specified otherwise). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>8.2. Play that is not dead is “live”. </li>
  <li>8.3. The thrower may not transfer possession of the disc during dead play to another player. </li>
  <li>8.4. Any player may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after it has hit the ground. 8.4.1. If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a player significantly alters the disc's position, the opposition may request that the pivot point be established at the location where the disc was contacted. </li>
  <li>8.5. After a turnover, and after the pull, an offensive player must move at walking pace or faster to directly retrieve the disc and establish a pivot point. 
    <ul>
        <li>8.5.1. In addition to 8.5, after a turnover r the thrower must establish a pivot point within ten (10) seconds of the disc coming to rest. </li>
        <li>8.5.2. If the offence breaches 8.5, or 8.5.1, the defence may give a warning (“Delay of Game” or using a pre-stall) or may call a “Violation”. 
            <ul>
                <li>8.5.2.1. If, after a warning, the offence continues to breach 8.5, or 8.5.1, then 9.3.1 does not apply and the marker may commence the stall count. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>8.5.3. The defence must not move in a manner that obstructs the offence from taking possession of the disc or establishing a pivot point.</li>
        <li>8.5.4. If players cannot agree on the correct pivot location, the relevant midpoint between the two proposed pivot locations must be used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="9-stall-count">9. Stall Count </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>9.1. The marker administers a stall count on the thrower by announcing “Stalling” and then counting from one (1) to five (5). The interval between the start of each number in the stall count must be at least one (1) second. </li>
  <li>9.2. The stall count must be clearly communicated to the thrower. </li>
  <li>9.3. The marker may only start and continue a stall count when: 
    <ul>
        <li>9.3.1. Play is live, or once a pivot point is established after a turnover; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>9.4. After a stoppage in play the stall count is resumed as follows: 
    <ul>
        <li>9.4.1. After an accepted breach by the defence the stall count restarts at “Stalling one (1)”. </li>
        <li>9.4.2. After an accepted breach by the offence the stall count restarts at maximum three (3). </li>
        <li>9.4.3. After a contested stall-out the stall count restarts at “Stalling three (3)”. </li>
        <li>9.4.4. After continuation of play in accordance with rule 16.3.2 the stall count restarts at “Stalling one (1)”.</li>
        <li>9.4.4. After all other calls the stall count restarts at maximum three (3). However: 
            <ul>
                <li>9.4.4.1. If there is a call involving the thrower, and a separate receiving breach, and the disc is returned to the thrower, the stall count is resumed based on the outcome of the call involving the thrower. </li>
                <li>9.4.4.2. If there is a violation called related to The Check (Section 10.), the stall count resumes at the same count that was determined prior to that violation. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>9.5. To restart a stall count “at maximum n”, means the following: 
    <ul>
        <li>9.5.1. If “x” is the last agreed number fully uttered prior to the call, then the stall count resumes at “Stalling (x plus one)” or “Stalling n”, whichever of those two numbers is lower. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="10-the-check">10. The Check </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>10.1. Whenever play stops during a point for a foul, violation, contested turnover, specified turnover, contested goal, stoppage, discussion, or at the completion of a time-out, play must restart as quickly as possible with a check. The check may only be delayed for the discussion of a call. </li>
  <li>10.2. Player positioning after a call (except in the case of a time-out, and unless specified otherwise): 
    <ul>
        <li>10.2.1. If play stops before a pass is thrown, all players must return to the location they held when the call was made. </li>
        <li>10.2.2. If play stops after a pass is thrown, then: 
            <ul>
                <li>10.2.2.1. if the disc is returned to the thrower, all players must return to the location they held when the thrower released the pass, or the time of the call, whichever is earlier. </li>
                <li>10.2.2.2. if the result of the play stands all players must return to the location they held when either a player established possession, or the disc hit the ground. </li>
                <li>10.2.2.3. if a player other than the thrower gains possession as a result of an accepted breach, all players must return to the location they held when the breach occurred. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>10.2.3. All players must remain stationary in that location until the disc is checked in. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>10.3. Any player may briefly extend a stoppage of play to fix faulty equipment (“equipment”), but active play may not be stopped for this purpose. </li>
  <li>10.4. Prior to the check the person checking the disc in, and the nearest opposition player, must verify that their own team-mates are ready, and positioned as per 10.2. </li>
  <li>10.5. If there is an unnecessary delay in checking the disc in, the opposition may give a warning (“Delay of Game”). If the delay continues, the team that gave the warning may check the disc in by calling “Disc In”, without verification from the opposition, but only if the team checking the disc in are all stationary, and positioned as per 10.2. </li>
  <li>10.6. To restart play with a check: 
    <ul>
        <li>10.6.1. when the thrower has the disc: 
            <ul>
                <li>10.6.1.1. if there is a defender within reach, the defender must touch the disc. </li>
                <li>10.6.1.2. if there is not a defender within reach, the thrower must touch the disc to the ground and may call “Disc In”. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>10.6.2. when the disc is on the ground, the defender nearest to the disc must call “Disc In”. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>10.7. A player may call a violation regarding the check if an opponent: 
    <ul>
        <li>10.7.1. attempts a pass without an appropriate check as per 10.6; or </li>
        <li>10.7.2. restarts play without verification from their nearest opposition player; or </li>
        <li>10.7.3. is moving immediately prior to the check; or </li>
        <li>10.7.4. was not in the appropriate position. </li>
        <li>10.7.5. After this violation call any pass does not count regardless of whether it is complete or incomplete, and possession reverts back to the thrower (unless 16.3 applies). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="11-out-of-bounds">11. Out-of-Bounds </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>11.1. The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are out-ofbounds. All non-players are part of the out-of-bounds area. </li>
  <li>11.2. The out-of-bounds area consists of the ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact with it, except for defensive players, who are always considered “in-bounds”. </li>
  <li>11.3. An offensive player who is not out-of-bounds is in-bounds. 
    <ul>
        <li>11.3.1. An airborne player retains their in-bounds/out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the playing field or the out-of-bounds area. </li>
        <li>11.3.2. A player who has caught the disc, who contacts the playing field and then contacts an out-ofbounds area, is still considered in-bounds, as long as they maintain the catch until they establish possession. 
            <ul>
                <li>11.3.2.1. If they leave the playing field, they must establish a pivot point at the location on the playing field where they crossed the perimeter line (unless 14.3 is in effect). </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>11.3.3. A thrower who contacts an out-of-bounds area is considered in-bounds until they make a pass. </li>
        <li>11.3.4. Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from one to another. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>11.4. The following are out-of-bounds turnovers, and no catch is deemed to have occurred: 
    <ul>
        <li>11.4.1. any part of an offensive receiver is out-of-bounds when they contact the disc; or </li>
        <li>11.4.2. after catching the disc while airborne, an offensive receiver's first contact is out-of-bounds while still in contact with the disc. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>11.5. A disc is in-bounds once play is live, or when play starts or restarts. </li>
  <li>11.6. A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area or contacts an out-ofbounds offensive player. A disc that has been caught by an offensive player has the same in/out-ofbounds status as that player. If the disc is simultaneously caught by more than one offensive player, one of them being out-of-bounds, the disc is out-of-bounds. </li>
  <li>11.7. The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the playing field, and players may go out-ofbounds to make a play on the disc. </li>
  <li>11.8. The place where a disc went out-of-bounds is the location where, prior to contacting an out-of-bounds area or player, the disc was most recently: 
    <ul>
        <li>11.8.1. partly or wholly over the playing field; or </li>
        <li>11.8.2. contacted by an in-bounds player. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>11.9. If the disc is out-of-bounds and more than three (3) metres from the pivot location, non-players may retrieve the disc. The thrower must carry the disc the last three (3) metres to the playing field. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="12-receivers-and-positioning">12. Receivers and Positioning </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>12.1. A “catch” occurs when a player has a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts. A catch can enable a player to establish possession of the disc. 
    <ul>
        <li>12.1.1. If the player fails to maintain the catch due to subsequent ground contact related to the catch, or contact related to the catch with a team-mate or a legitimately positioned opposition player, possession is deemed to have not occurred. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>12.2. After establishing possession, that player becomes the thrower. </li>
  <li>12.3. If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously, the offence retains possession. </li>
  <li>12.4. A player in an established position is entitled to remain in that position and must not be contacted by an opposing player. </li>
  <li>12.5. Every player is entitled to occupy any position on the field not occupied by any opposing player, provided that they do not initiate contact in taking such a position, and are not moving in a reckless or dangerously aggressive manner. 
    <ul>
        <li>12.5.1. However when the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to make a play on the disc. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>12.6. All players must attempt to avoid initiating contact with other players, and there is no situation where a player may justify initiating contact. This includes avoiding initiating contact with a stationary opponent, or an opponent's expected position based on their established speed and direction. 
    <ul>
        <li>“Making a play for the disc” is not a valid excuse for initiating contact with other players. </li>
        <li>12.6.2. Before a player dives, leaps or jumps away from their position, they must be reasonably certain they will not initiate contact with an opponent</li>
        <li>12.6.3. If a player is not reasonably certain that they will be able to make a legal play at the disc before an opponent who is moving in a legal manner, they must adjust their movements to avoid initiating contact. If that adjustment is made, the result of the play still stands. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>12.7. The player who initiates contact is deemed to be the player who: 
    <ul>
        <li>12.7.1. arrived at the point of contact after the opponent had already established a legitimate position at that point (either a stationary or moving opponent), or </li>
        <li>12.7.2. adjusted their movements in a way that created unavoidable contact with an opponent moving in a legal manner, when taking into account all players' established position, speed and direction.</li>
        <li>12.7.3. If it is unclear which player initiated contact, and one of the players dived, leaped or jumped away from their position, that player is deemed to have initiated contact.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>12.8. Some minor contact may occur as two or more players move towards a single point simultaneously. Minor contact should be minimized but is not considered a foul. </li>
  <li>12.9. Players may not use their extended arms or legs to obstruct the movement of opposing players. </li>
  <li>12.10. No player may physically assist the movement of another player, nor use an item of equipment or object to assist in contacting the disc. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="13-turnovers">13. Turnovers </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>13.1. A turnover that transfers possession of the disc from one team to the other occurs when: 
    <ul>
        <li>13.1.1. the disc contacts the ground while it is not in the possession of an offensive player (a “down”); 13.1.1.1. however it is not “down” if a receiver catches a pass before the disc contacts the ground, and maintains the catch while the disc is in contact with the ground. </li>
        <li>13.1.2. a defensive player establishes possession of a pass (an “interception”); </li>
        <li>13.1.3. the disc becomes out-of-bounds (an “out-of-bounds” or “out”); or </li>
        <li>13.1.4. during the pull, the offence touches the disc before it hits the ground, and subsequently fails to establish possession of the disc (a “dropped pull”). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13.2. A turnover that transfers possession of the disc from one team to the other, and results in a stoppage of play, occurs when: 
    <ul>
        <li>13.2.1. there is an accepted offensive receiving foul; </li>
        <li>13.2.2. the thrower has not released the pass before the marker first starts to say the word “ten” in the stall count (a “stall-out”); </li>
        <li>13.2.3. the disc is intentionally transferred from one offensive player to another without ever being completely untouched by both players (a “handover”); </li>
        <li>13.2.4. the thrower intentionally deflects a pass to themselves off another player (a “deflection”); </li>
        <li>13.2.5. in attempting a pass, the thrower catches the disc after release prior to the disc being contacted by another player (a “self-catch”); </li>
        <li>13.2.6. an offensive player intentionally assists a team-mate's movement to catch a pass; or </li>
        <li>13.2.7. an offensive player uses an item of equipment or object to assist in catching a pass. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13.3. If a player determines a turnover has occurred they must make the appropriate call immediately. If the opposition disagrees they may call “contest” and play must stop. If, after discussion, players cannot agree or it is unclear what occurred in the play, the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower. </li>
  <li>13.4. After a “stall-out” call: 
    <ul>
        <li>13.4.1. If the thrower still has possession of the disc, but they believe a fast count occurred in such a manner that they did not have a reasonable opportunity to call fast count before a stall-out, the play is treated as either an accepted defensive breach (9.5.1) or a contested stall-out (9.5.3). 13.4.2. If the thrower made a completed pass, the thrower can contest if they believe it was not a “stall-out”, or there was a fast count immediately prior to the “stall-out”. </li>
        <li>13.4.2. If the thrower contests a stall-out but also attempts a pass, and the pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands and play restarts with a check. </li>
    </ul>
  <li>13.5. Any offensive player may establish possession of the disc after a turnover, except: 
    <ul>
        <li>13.5.1. after an “interception” turnover, in which case the player who made the interception must maintain possession; and </li>
        <li>13.5.2. after an accepted receiving foul caused by the offence, in which case the fouled player must establish possession.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13.6. If the player in possession after a turnover, or after a pull that has already hit the ground, intentionally drops the disc, places the disc on the ground, or transfers possession of the disc, they must re-establish possession and restart play with a check. </li>
  <li>13.7. After a turnover, the turnover location is where: 
    <ul>
        <li>13.7.1. the disc has come to a stop or is picked up by an offensive player; or </li>
        <li>13.7.2. the intercepting player stops; or </li>
        <li>13.7.3. the thrower was located at the time of the call, in the case of 13.2.2, 13.2.3, 13.2.4, 13.2.5; or </li>
        <li>13.7.4. the offensive player was located, in the case of 13.2.6 and 13.2.7; or </li>
        <li>13.7.5. the accepted offensive receiving foul occurred. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13.8. If the turnover location is out-of-bounds, or the disc touched an out-of-bounds area after the turnover occurred, the thrower must establish a pivot point at the location on the central zone nearest to where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.8). 
    <ul>
        <li>13.8.1. If 13.8 does not apply, a pivot point must be established according to 13.9, 13.10, or 13.11. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13.9. If the turnover location is in the central zone, the thrower must establish a pivot point at that location. </li>
  <li>13.10. If the turnover location is in the offence's attacking end zone, the thrower must establish a pivot point at the nearest location on the goal line. </li>
  <li>13.11. If the turnover location is in the offence's defending end zone, the thrower may choose where to establish a pivot point: 
    <ul>
        <li>13.11.1. at the turnover location, by staying at the turnover location or faking a pass; or </li>
        <li>13.11.2. at the nearest location on the goal line to the turnover location, by moving from the turnover location. 
            <ul>
                <li>13.11.2.1. The intended thrower, before picking up the disc, may signal the goal line option by fully extending one arm above their head. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>13.11.3. Immediate movement, staying at the turnover location, faking a pass, or signaling the goal line option, determines where to establish a pivot point and cannot be reversed. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>13.12. If, after an accepted turnover, play has continued unknowingly, play stops and the disc is returned to the turnover location, players resume their positions at the time the turnover occurred and play restarts with a check. </li>
  <li>13.13. If an offensive player has a non-minor contact with the goal (“Goal foul”) </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="14-scoring">14. Scoring </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>14.1. A goal is scored if a player in the goal zone catches a legal assist (a disc that flew entirely unaided threw the goal from teh playing area) and: 
    <ul>
        <li>14.1.1. all their ground contacts are entirely within the goal zone, or for an airborne player, all of their first simultaneous points of ground contact after catching the disc are entirely within the goal zone, and </li>
        <li>14.1.2. they subsequently establish possession of the disc, and maintain the catch throughout all ground contact related to the catch (note 12.1, 12.1.1). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>14.2. If a player believes a goal has been scored, they may call “goal”. Play does not stop. After a contested or retracted goal call play must restart with a check and the call is deemed to have been made when the player established possession. </li>
  <li>14.3. The time at which a goal is deemed to have been scored is when the player established possession. </li>

<h2 id="15-calling-fouls-infractions-and-violations">15. Calling Fouls, Infractions and Violations </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>15.1. A breach of the rules due to non-minor contact between two or more opposing players is a foul. 
    <ul>
        <li>15.1.1. A player intentionally initiating minor contact is still a breach of the rules, but is to be treated as a violation, and not a foul. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>15.2. A breach of the rules regarding a Marking or Travel breach is an infraction. Infractions do not stop play. </li>
  <li>15.3. Every other breach of the rules is a violation. </li>
  <li>15.4. Only the player fouled may claim a foul, by calling “Foul”. </li>
  <li>15.5. In general only the thrower may claim an infraction, by calling the specific name of the infraction. 15.5.1. However and any defensive player may call a travel infraction. </li>
  <li>15.6. Any opposing player may claim a violation, by calling the specific name of the violation or “Violation”, unless specified otherwise by the particular rule. </li>
  <li>15.7. When a foul or violation call is made that stops play, players must stop play by visibly or audibly communicating the stoppage as soon as they are aware of the call and all players should echo calls on the field. If play has stopped for a discussion without any call having been made, a call is deemed to have been made when the discussion started. </li>
  <li>15.8. Calls must be made immediately after the breach is recognised. </li>
  <li>15.9. After a player initiates a stoppage incorrectly, including after mishearing a call, not knowing the rules, or not making the call immediately: 
    <ul>
        <li>15.9.1. if the opposition gains or retains possession, any subsequent play stands, </li>
        <li>15.9.2. if the opposition does not gain or retain possession, the disc must be returned to the last nondisputed thrower, unless 16.3 applies. </li>
        <li>15.9.3. The stall count resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by the player who initiated the stoppage incorrectly. </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
  <li>15.10. If the player against whom the foul, infraction or violation has been called disagrees that it occurred, or does not think it is a correct call, they may call “Contest”. </li>
  <li>15.11. If a player making any call subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they can retract the call, by calling “Retracted”. Play resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by that player. </li>
  <li>15.12. If multiple breaches occur on the same play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved in reverse sequence (latest breach first, earliest breach last). </li>
  <li>15.13. Players are encouraged to use the WFDF Hand Signals to communicate all calls. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="16-continuation-after-a-call">16. Continuation after a Call </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>16.1. Whenever a foul or violation call is made, or a player attempts to stop play in any way, play stops immediately and no turnover is possible (unless in situations specified in 15.9, 16.2, and 16.3). </li>
  <li>16.2. If a foul or violation: 
    <ul>
        <li>16.2.1. is called against the thrower and the thrower attempts a pass, or </li>
        <li>16.2.2. is called by the thrower during the act of throwing, or </li>
        <li>16.2.3. is called or occurs when the disc is in the air, </li>
        <li>then play continues until possession has been established. </li>
        <li>16.2.4. Once possession has been established: 
            <ul>
                <li>16.2.4.1. If the team that called the foul or violation gains or retains possession as a result of the pass, the play stands. Play can continue without a stoppage if the player who made the foul or violation call makes a “Play on” call as soon as possible. </li>
                <li>16.2.4.2. If the team that called the foul or violation does not gain or retain possession as a result of the pass, play must be stopped. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>16.2.4.2.1. If the team that called the foul or violation believes that possession has been affected by the foul or violation, the disc will be returned to the thrower for a check (unless the specific rule says otherwise). </li>
                    </ul>

  <li>16.3. Regardless of when any call is made, if the players involved from both teams agree that the event or call did not affect the outcome, the play stands. This rule is not superseded by any other rule. 
    <ul>
        <li>16.3.1. If the play resulted in a goal, the goal stands. </li>
        <li>16.3.2. If the play did not result in a goal the affected players may make up any positional disadvantage caused by the event or call and restart play with a check. </li>
    </ul>

</ul>



<h2 id="17-fouls">17. Fouls </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
    <li>17.1. Dangerous Play: 
        <ul>
            <li>17.1.1. Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of fellow players, or posing significant risk of injury to fellow players, or other dangerously aggressive behaviours, are considered dangerous play and must be treated as a foul, regardless of whether or when contact occurs. This rule is not superseded by any other foul rule. If the dangerous play call is accepted, this must be treated as the most relevant foul from Section 17. </li>
        </ul>
    </li> 
    <li>17.2. Receiving Fouls: 
        <ul>
            <li>17.2.1. A Receiving Foul occurs when a player initiates non-minor contact with an opponent before, while, or directly after, either player makes a play on the disc. 
                <ul>
                    <li>17.2.1.1. Contact with an opponent's arms or hands, that occurs after the disc has been caught, or after the opponent can no longer make a play on the disc, is not a sufficient basis for a foul, but should be avoided (excluding contact related to Section 17.1 and 17.3). </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>17.2.2. After an accepted receiving foul the fouled player gains possession at the location of the breach, even if that location is in an end zone, and play restarts with a check. If, after the check, 14.3 applies, the stall count can not be started until a pivot point is established at the nearest location on the goal line. If the foul is contested, the disc is returned to the thrower. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>17.3. Strip Fouls:
        <ul>
            <li>17.3.1. A Strip Foul occurs when an opponent fouls a player and that causes the player to drop a disc they caught or to lose possession of the disc. </li>
            <li>17.3.2. If the reception would have otherwise been a goal, and the foul is accepted, a goal is awarded. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>17.4. Blocking Fouls:
        <ul>
            <li>17.4.1. A Blocking Foul occurs when a player takes a position that an opponent moving in a legal manner will be unable to avoid, taking into account the opponents expected position based on their established speed and direction, and non-minor contact results. This is to be treated as either a receiving foul or an indirect foul, whichever is applicable. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>17.5. Force-out Fouls: 
        <ul>
            <li>17.5.1. A Force-out Foul occurs when a receiver is in the process of establishing possession of the disc, and is fouled by a defensive player subsequently establishing possession, and the contact caused the receiver: 
                <ul>
                    <li>17.5.1.1. to catch the disc out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds; or </li>
                    <li>17.5.1.2. to catch the disc in the playing area instead of the goal zone. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>17.5.2. If the receiver would have caught the disc in the goal zone, it is a goal; </li>
            <li>17.5.3. If the force-out foul is contested, the disc is returned to the thrower if the receiver became out-of-bounds, otherwise the disc stays with the receiver. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>17.6. Defensive Throwing (Marking) Fouls:
        <ul>
            <li>17.6.1. A Defensive Throwing Foul occurs when: 
                <ul>
                    <li>17.6.1.1. There is non-minor contact between the thrower and an illegally positioned defensive player (Section 18.1); or </li>
                    <li>17.6.1.2. A defensive player initiates non-minor contact with the thrower, or there is non-minor contact resulting from the thrower and the defender both vying for the same unoccupied position, prior to the thrower releasing the pass. </li>
                    <li>17.6.1.3. If a Defensive Throwing Foul occurs prior to the thrower releasing the pass and not during the throwing motion, the thrower may choose to call a contact infraction, by calling “Contact”. After a contact infraction that is not contested, play does not stop and the marker must resume the stall count at one (1). </li>
                </ul>
            </li>   
        </ul>
    </li>   
    <li>17.7. Offensive Throwing (Thrower) Fouls:
        <ul>
            <li>17.7.1. An Offensive Throwing Foul occurs when the thrower is solely responsible for initiating nonminor contact with a defensive player who is in a legal position. </li>
            <li>17.7.2. Contact occurring during the thrower's follow through is not a sufficient basis for a foul, but should be avoided. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>17.8. Indirect Fouls: 
        <ul>
            <li>17.8.1. An Indirect Foul occurs when there is non-minor contact between a receiver and a defensive player that does not directly affect an attempt to make a play on the disc. 
              <ul>
                <li>. Prior to making the "Indirect Foul" call, the player may delay the call up to two (2) seconds to determine if the breach will affect the play.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>17.8.2. If the foul is accepted the fouled player may make up any positional disadvantage caused by the foul. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>17.9. Offsetting Fouls: 
        <ul>
            <li>17.9.1. If accepted fouls are called by offensive and defensive players on the same play, these are offsetting fouls, and the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower. </li>
            <li>17.9.2. If there is non-minor contact that is caused by two or more opposing players moving towards a single point simultaneously, this must be treated as offsetting fouls. 
                <ul>
                    <li>17.9.2.1. However if this occurs after the disc has been caught, or after the relevant player/s involved can no longer make a play on the disc, this must be treated as an Indirect Foul (excluding contact related to Section 17.1). </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

<h2 id="18-infractions-and-violations">18. Infractions and Violations </h2>
<ul class="nolist">
  <li>18.1. Marking Infractions: 
    <ul>
        <li>18.1.1. Marking infractions include the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>18.1.1.1. “Fast Count” - the marker: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>18.1.1.1.1. starts or continues the stall count illegally, </li>
                        <li>18.1.1.1.2. does not start or restart the stall count with “Stalling”, </li>
                        <li>18.1.1.1.3. counts in less than one second intervals, </li>
                        <li>18.1.1.1.4. does not correctly reduce or reset the stall count when required, or </li>
                        <li>18.1.1.1.5. does not start the stall count from the correct number. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>18.1.1.2. “Vision” - a defensive player uses any part of their body to intentionally obstruct the thrower's vision. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.1.2. A marking infraction may be contested by the defence, in which case play stops. 
            <ul>
                <li>18.1.2.1. If a pass has been completed, a contested or retracted marking infraction must be treated as a violation by the offence, and the disc must be returned to the thrower. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.1.3. After all marking infractions listed in 18.1.1 and where play has not stopped, the marker must resume the stall count with the number last fully uttered before the call, minus one (1). 
          <ul>
            <li>18.1.3.1. The marker must not resume counting until any illegal positioning has been corrected. To do otherwise is a subsequent marking infraction.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.1.4. The marker may not resume counting until any illegal positioning has been corrected. To do otherwise is a subsequent marking infraction. </li>
        <li>18.1.5. Instead of calling a marking infraction, the  relevant player may call a marking violation and stop play if: 
            <ul>
                <li>18.1.5.1. the stall count is not corrected, </li>
                <li>18.1.5.2. there is no stall count, </li>
                <li>18.1.5.3. there is an egregious marking infraction, or </li>
                <li>18.1.5.4. there is a pattern of repeated marking infractions. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.1.6. If a marking infraction, or a marking violation, is called and the thrower also attempts a pass before, during or after the call, the call has no consequences (unless 18.1.2.1 applies) and if the pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18.2. “Travel” Infractions: 
    <ul>
        <li>18.2.1. After catching the disc, the thrower must reduce speed as quickly as possible, without changing direction, until they have established a pivot point. 
            <ul>
                <li>18.2.1.1. However if a player catches the disc while running or jumping the player may release a pass without attempting to reduce speed and without establishing a pivot point, provided that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>18.2.1.1.1. they do not change direction or increase speed until they release the pass; and </li>
                        <li>18.2.1.1.2. a maximum of two additional points of contact with the ground are made after the catch and before they release the pass. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>        
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.2.2. The thrower may move in any direction (pivot) only by establishing and maintaining a pivot point until releasing a pass.. </li>
        <li>18.2.3. A thrower who is not standing can use any part of their body as the pivot point. 
            <ul>
                <li>18.2.3.1. If they stand up it is not a travel, but only if a pivot point is established at the same location. </li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        <li>18.2.4. A travel infraction occurs if: 
            <ul>
                <li>18.2.4.1. the thrower establishes a pivot point at an incorrect location, including by not reducing speed as quickly as possible after a catch, or changing direction after a catch; </li>
                <li>18.2.4.2. the thrower releases a pass in breach of 18.2.2.1; </li>
                <li>18.2.4.3. anytime the thrower must move to a specified location, the thrower does not establish a pivot point before a wind-up or throwing motion begins; </li>
                <li>18.2.4.4. the thrower fails to keep the established pivot point until releasing a pass; </li>
                <li>18.2.4.5. a player intentionally bobbles, fumbles or delays the disc to themselves, for the sole purpose of moving in a specific direction. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.2.5. After an accepted travel infraction is called (“travel”), play does not stop.
            <ul>
                <li>18.2.5.1. The thrower establishes a pivot point at the correct location, as indicated by the player who called the travel. This must occur without delay from either player involved. </li>
                <li>18.2.5.2. Any stall count is paused, and the thrower may not throw the disc, until a pivot point is established at the correct location. </li>
                <li>18.2.5.3. The marker does not need to say “Stalling” before resuming the stall count. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>18.2.6. If, after a travel infraction but before correcting the pivot point, the thrower throws a completed pass, the defensive team may call a travel violation. Play stops and the disc is returned to the thrower. The thrower must return to the location occupied at the time of the infraction. Play must restart with a check. </li>
        <li>18.2.7. If, after a travel infraction, the thrower throws an incomplete pass, play continues. </li>
        <li>18.2.8. After a contested travel infraction where the thrower has not released  a pass, play stops. </li>
    </ul>

<ul class="nolist">
    <li>19.1. Injury Stoppage 
        <ul>
            <li>19.1.1. An injury stoppage, “Injury”, may be called by the injured player, or by any player on the injured player's team. </li>
            <li>19.1.2. If the injury was not caused by an opponent, the player must choose either to be substituted, or to charge their own team with a time-out. </li>
            <li>19.1.3. If the injury was caused by an opponent, the player may choose to stay or to be substituted. </li>
            <li>19.1.4. If the injured player had established possession of the disc, and the player has dropped the disc due to the injury, that player retains possession of the disc. </li>

            <li>19.2.1. Any player who recognises a condition that endangers players, including if a player has an open or bleeding wound, should call a technical stoppage by calling “technical” or “stop”. Play must stop immediately. 
                <ul>
                    <li>19.2.1.1. A team-mate, coach, or designated official, should actively alert players to any condition that endangers players. </li>
                    <li>19.2.1.2. A player who has an issue regarding an open or bleeding wound has seventy (70) seconds to effectively address the issue. If they need additional time to address the issue, they must choose either to be substituted, or to charge their own team with a time-out. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>19.2.2. The thrower may call a technical stoppage during play to replace a severely damaged disc. </li>
            <li>19.2.3. After a technical stoppage called while the disc is in the air, or if play has continued unknowingly: 
                <ul>
                    <li>19.2.3.1. If the call or issue did not affect play, the completion or turnover stands, and play restarts there; </li>
                    <li>19.2.3.2. If the call or issue did affect the play, the disc goes back to the thrower. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>19.3. If a player is substituted after an injury, or due to illegal or faulty equipment, the opposing team may also choose to substitute one player. 
                <ul>
                    <li>19.3.1. Substitute players take on the full state (location, possession, stall count etc) of the player they are substituting and may make a call on their behalf. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
