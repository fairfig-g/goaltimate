<h1>History</h1>
<p>Goaltimate was invented by Ultimate players in Wellesley, Massachusetts, on Christmas Day 1978. The rules were developed as they played, and they used the lower spars of a set of H-shaped American football uprights as a goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usaultimate.org/about/history/hall_of_fame/jim_herrick_class_of_2005.aspx">Jim Herrick</a>, one of the Boston inventors, brought the game to San Diego, where it was further developed and replaced the uprights with a large hoop made with PVC pipes. In 1999, Rick and Bibbi Conner, San Diego entrepreneurs with interest in the sport, subsidized a goaltimate tournament with a US$30,000 purse for the winners, inviting top players from competitive ultimate teams. Through this introduction, the sport rapidly spread across the world. Less than one year after there were games organised not just in the USA, but also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Denmark, Scotland, Venezuela, Mexico, Sweden, and the UK.</p>
<p>At that time, the rules were defined by the International Goaltimate Organisation, led by Rick Conner. The rules were quite different, and included a round field.</p>

<p>The sport is now thriving in the USA, thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.usagoaltimate.org/">USA Goaltimate</a>, the USA organization for the sport of Goaltimate, which has published its own set of <a href="https://www.usagoaltimate.org/full-rule-set">rules</a>.</p>

<p>As Goaltimate is spreading worldwide, multiple groups have developed different rules. Our rules are based on the style of play that have become popular across Europe, and specifically by the rules used by the Royal Goaltimate Society in London, UK. Some small changes have been made to make the sport more skill-based, inclusive, and fun.</p>
